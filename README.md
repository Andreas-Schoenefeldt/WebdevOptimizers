# WebDev Optimzer Suite

This is a set of php scripts, that are supposed to make the life of a webdeveloper more easy. Its a loose set of functions mainly for automating repetive and anoying tasks, that are quite error prone to humans.

## main scripts
* 'AnalyseLogfiles.php' - Automatied Logfile Parsing Script
* 'codecontrol.php' - A Wrapper Script to unify SVN and git access
* 'CreateSeleniumTestSuite.php' - Automate a Test generation for Selenium
* 'AddTranslation.php' - A script, that can parse template files for plaon text strings and replace them by a i18n like localisation function like ${Resource.msg('account', 'account.headline.main', null)} - it is still verry experimental and should not be used without a possibility of rollback all the changes it has made.
